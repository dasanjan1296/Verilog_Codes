# Verilog-Snippets
A host for small Verilog-Snippets brewed during Lab Sessions of **Computer Architecture** Course at **BITS-Pilani**.

   * This repository will hold certain scratch-pad models of **MIPS**(Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) *DataPath* and *Control Unit* for different implementations.
   
   * It may at later stages also contain certain parts related to *Memory Segment.*
